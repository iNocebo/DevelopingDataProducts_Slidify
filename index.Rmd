## What is Vancomycin? 

```{r xml, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
require(xml)
```

- Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic used for severe bacterial infections 
- It is known for being a last line treatment of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus - also known as MRSA 

### Vancomycin dosing regimens need careful evaluation: 
- Dosing should be high enough to prevent the further spread of resistant bacteria 
- Dosing should be low enough to prevent adverse drug reactions such as kidney damage, hearing impairment or rash

## Why do we need an application for dosing Vancomycin 

- Vancomycin elimination (read: "pushing the drug out of the body") is heavily dependant on renal function 
- Estimating the renal function of the patient is necessary to dose Vancomycin correctly and individually 
- The renal function of a patient can be estimated when *sex*, *age*, *body weight* and *plasma Creatinine concentrations* are known
- Concentrations present in the patient's body can be estimated when renal function, dose and dosing intervals are known
 
- **An application performing quick and easy calculations will promote safer and more efficient Vancomycin use and may promote drug knowledge in a playful environment.**

## Calculate your own distribution volume of Vancomycin right now!

```{r opts.label = "shiny", echo = FALSE}
slidifyUI(
        sidebarPanel(
                numericInput("bw", "Enter your body weight in kg:", value = 70, min = 5, 
                             max = 140, step = 1.0)
        ),
        mainPanel(
                p("Vancomycin would dilute itself in the following distribution volume [L] within your body: "),
                verbatimTextOutput("odistr")
        )
)
